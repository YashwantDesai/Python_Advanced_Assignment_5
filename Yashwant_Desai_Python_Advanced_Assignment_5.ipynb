    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes in Python is to reduce the risk of name collisions, promote data encapsulation, and provide clarity and documentation within a class. These attributes are not truly private but are named with double underscores to signal their intended internal use and discourage direct access from outside the class. They encourage the use of getter and setter methods for better control over attribute access.\n",
    "Below are the main purposes of pseudoprivate attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Name Collision Prevention: By prefixing an attribute name with double underscores, you reduce the chances of naming conflicts with attributes in subclasses or external code. It's a way to signal to other programmers that the attribute should be treated as private and not modified directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Data Encapsulation: Pseudoprivate attributes promote encapsulation by discouraging direct access to instance variables. Instead, you are encouraged to use getter and setter methods (e.g., get_my_variable and set_my_variable) to access or modify these attributes. This allows for better control over attribute access and can help maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Documentation and Clarity: When you encounter an attribute with a double underscore prefix, it signals that this attribute is intended for internal use within the class. It serves as a form of documentation, helping to convey the intended usage of the attribute to other developers."
